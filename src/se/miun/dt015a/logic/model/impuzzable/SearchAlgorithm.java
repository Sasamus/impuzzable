	 * Thoughts:
	 * 
	 * I had a lot of ideas of things that could speed things up but most of
	 * them required work and/or preprocessing that took more time than it's use
	 * saved.
	 * 
	 * Other things I simply couldn't make work. Some, perhaps, because they
	 * shouldn't work and some because I couldn't manage to get it to work.
	 * 
	 * Backtracking, for example, always ran into the problem of repeatedly
	 * placing the same pieces or same sequences of pieces over and over again.
	 * 
	 * While it seems fairly simple to resolve none of my approaches worked out.
	 * So I gave up on that because of time constraints.
	 * 
	 * In the end, my algorithm works, and judging by the times others have
	 * talked about it's pretty fast. Which doesn't make too much sense since
	 * it's fairly crude and relies too much on brute force for my tastes,
	 * although there are some things that make it somewhat clever.
	 * 
	 * I get and average of 1-1.2 microseconds, just for reference.
	 * 
	 * So I suspect my superior times are a product of a better CPU and
	 * possibly a more efficient testing system and not a superior algorithm.
	 * 
	 * I'm not too satisfied with it but don't have time to do more. So I've
	 * given up my hopes of being fastest and have to aim at completing the
	 * assignment.
